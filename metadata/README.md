# Thaumium Metadata (formerly Heridium)

This has been migrated to the primary monorepo due to the inconvenience of maintaining two repositries with ToolKit classes.

If you want to use metadata classes without any of the overhead, you should only need to use the `source` and `toolkit` folders with `metadata.h`.
