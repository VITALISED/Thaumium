# Thaumium Metadata (formerly Heridium)

This has been migrated to the primary monorepo due to the inconvenience of maintaining two repositries with ToolKit classes.

If you want to use metadata classes without any of the overhead, you should only need to use the `source` and `toolkit` folders with `metadata.h`. Along with this you'll also need ToolKit types, these are provided in the `common` directory, however due to my limited time available to test some sizes might be incorrect, along with some guesses for types since many are unused. If you know better please submit an issue/PR.
